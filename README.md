# INR Tracker App

Inspired by my requirement for lifetime anticoagulation medication, I developed a full-stack iOS application to manage and visualize my INR (International Normalized Ratio) blood test results. Node.js server handles all basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) methods and is deployed with Google App Engine. The database is hosted with MongoDB Atlas.
